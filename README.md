# First-help-of-Copilot
This repo contain a program written with the help of GitHub Copilot Tool and comparing it with the original version.
1) The motivation for using GitHub Copilot is to exploit this AI-based tool for increasing my coding process spedd
-and to make use of the free licence as a student for sure :D-

2) This Program was mainly written to convert male speech to inclusive speech 
For instance: converting "He is my hero. His talent is marvelous" ---> "He or she is my hero. His or her talent is marvelous"

3) I wrote this in about 45 min. 
with the copilot extention, it took just 15 min. or less and that lead to the same output accuracy.
The experience was worthy.
